This project was made for fun. I'm not responsible if you rekt your account...
Some tips to start
Install iconsdk with pip --- pip install iconsdk
Put all the files in the same dir in Pycharm
The wallet and the private key in this example are throwaway so don't give them much attention. 
Create a new wallet (don't mess with your main) and rename it. Be careful with your private key.
The default settings are for the testnet and we will change the bet amounts too.
I tried to explain the code with comments if you don't understand.


Enjoy, lol!
